"Othello," also known as "Reversi," is a classic two-player board game that is easy to learn but offers deep strategic gameplay. The game is typically played on an 8x8 grid (though variations with different board sizes exist), and the objective is to have the majority of your colored discs on the board when the game ends.

Here's an abstract of Othello (Reversi):

Objective: The goal of the game is to have more of your own color discs on the board than your opponent when there are no more legal moves.

Setup: The game board starts with two black discs and two white discs arranged diagonally in the center. Each player chooses a color (black or white).

Gameplay:

Players take turns.
On your turn, you must place one of your discs on the board in such a way that it captures one or more of your opponent's discs by sandwiching them between two of your own discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
When you make such a move, the captured opponent's discs are flipped to your color.
If you cannot make a legal move, you must pass, and your opponent gets another turn.
The game continues until there are no legal moves left for both players or the board is completely filled.
Winning: The player with the most discs of their color on the board when the game ends is the winner.

Strategy: Othello requires strategic thinking and planning. Players must anticipate their opponent's moves, control key positions on the board, and balance offense and defense.

Endgame: The endgame is crucial, as it often involves securing corners and edges, which are difficult to flip once they contain your discs
